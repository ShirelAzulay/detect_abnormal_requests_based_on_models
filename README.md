# SaltDetectAbnormal

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/). Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ, `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

If necessary, create an `application-local.yml` file to override your own settings for development.

In addition to the Spring Boot application, the DevServer must also be started. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) has to be available on the system - the latest LTS version is recommended. Only once the dependencies have to be installed:

```
npm install
```

The DevServer can now be started as follows:

```
npm run devserver
```

Using a proxy the whole application is now accessible under `localhost:8081`. All changes to the templates and JS/CSS files are immediately visible in the browser.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

Node.js is automatically downloaded using the `frontend-maven-plugin` and the final JS/CSS files are integrated into the jar.

The application can then be started with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/salt-detect-abnormal-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
